# Time Zone Converter

# Overview
In this project, I created a time zone converter application that would give the user different time zones for different city locations, in different countries of the world. 

The purpose was to help users provide the correct time and date of these different city locations and show that comparison to the user.

I wrote this software in Java to learn more about the language syntax, to challenge myself with something new and to get a better understanding of applying Java in programming use.
